# renshu_push_n_pull_master
## A Purpose
This repository was made for my practice and learning how to use some commands, for instance push, pull, and master etc., relates to git usage that I don't know about very much.

## Some Requests for visitors
If you are kind enough to teach me about git or English grammer, please give me some instructions or URLs of refrences.
